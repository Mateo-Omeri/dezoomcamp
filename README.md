Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a bootcamp offered by DataClubTalks, providing an introduction to the essential elements of data engineering, covering fundamentals to more complex concepts. Over six weeks, you will learn and practice every aspect of the entire data engineering process using popular technologies and tools such as GCP (GCS, BigQuery), Docker, MAGE, Spark, and Kafka. In this repository, you will find the code I've written for homework assignments.
